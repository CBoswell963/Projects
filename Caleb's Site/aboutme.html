            <p>I am Caleb Boswell, and I am an American otaku.</p>
            <p>Otaku is, in simple terms, the Japanese word for geek.  I feel it best describes me since most of my interests are anime and rpgs.  Since I was little I have always been a fan of anime and video games, with my earliest exposure being the Pokemon anime, of which I am still a fan today.  That show kickstarted my interest in anime and video games, starting with the Pokemon games themselves and eventually leading me to games like Final Fantasy X and Kingdom Hearts.</p>
            <p>These series instantly entranced me, as I not only enjoyed playing them, I was in awe of the people who made them.  Whether it be the incredible animations, the worlds and locations you could travel to, or the gameplay itself.  These games made me want to be a part of making them and led me to learn about programming</p>
            <p>I wanted to be a part of the game development process so I tried out multiple courses in school to see what I might like to do.  I wasn't too confident about my art, though considering what I was comparing myself to that seems like a given now, so I also tried some programming courses.  Once I did, I immediately found myself a new passion.</p>
            <p>Programming was something that I felt confident in doing, but something I honestly enjoyed doing as well.  I enjoyed the process of seeing the words I typed in displaying on the screen, it was fun figuring out the algorithms that were necessary to get the program to work how I wanted, and I always felt accomplished when programs or simulations worked the way I wanted them too.</p>
            <p>I have continued to study programming and have developed my skills to a degree where I can now offer my skills as a service.  I am still aiming to work in game development someday, but I am able and willing to do other programming work so I can continue to grow.  I know this was a rather long introduction to who I am, but I hope this helps you understand who I am and my passion towards what I do.</p>
            <p>I hope you will consider me for any projects you need assistance on.</p>
