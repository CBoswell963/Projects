Hello, I am Caleb Boswell.  I am a graduate of NC State University with a Bachelors in Computer Science.  I have enjoyed programming since and early age.  I enjoyed the process of creating a program to do what I want and seeing the results afterwards.  I also enjoyed the challenge of finding the issues with my code whenver I ran into an issue.
I am currently aiming to get into a career of Computer Science and right now I am looking for employment as a Data Analyst.  My skillset, experience and preferences have led me to this decision and I am currently expanding my portfolio to display my ability in this career path.

My skills include strong knowledge of multiple programming languages, a number of software tools and strong analytical and problem solving skills.  Some of my strongest programming languages are Python, C++, SQL and Java, with Python and SQL being the ones I use most often for data analysis work.  I am familiar with tools such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, Visual Studio Code, and Jupyter Notebooks.  I have knowledge of several other tools, but these are the ones I use most often for data analysis projects, much like the case with Python and SQL.

While I have not had work experience in a Data Analysis roles, one of my previous positions, as a technical intern for the North Carolina Business Committee of Education, did have me do data analysis work providing me with invaluable experience.

One project I had to work on while I was working there was using excel to create a pivot table of website user data for the North Carolina Business Committee of Education when I worked there as a technical intern.

I was tasked with extracting the user data from the site and then formatting it in excel to clearly display the regional demographics of the users of the site.

This was one of the first projects I had to do that involved data analysis in a work environment.  Furthermore, while I was familiar with programming languages used for data analysis, and was familiar with excel from multiple school assignments, I had not yet used it for performing data analysis.

One of the first challenges I had was extracting the user data.  Not only was there a large volume of it, but I was limited in the amount of user data I could extract at once or the download would fail.  To solve this issue, I first sorted the user data on the site then selected a specified amount of user data to extract according to their index in the site.  Then once I had downloaded all the data, I then compiled it into one spreadsheet while verifying that there were no overlaps or gaps in the user data due to the method I used.

After this, since it was my first time using Excel to create a visual for data analysis, I had to do online research on how to create pivot tables in excel in order to sort and display the data.  It took me some time and experimenting with the creation of the excel table to properly create one close to what I needed for work.

However, the first result was clunky with extra data and outlier variables and was not satisfactory.  It was then I realized the importance of cleaning the data, by removing unnecessary columns, combing certain columns into one that is more legible, splitting columns such as emails to obtain domain names, and removing rows that were not valid.

After I had completed all these steps, I was able to display a pivot table to my superior that easily displayed the user data by region and other factors, which aided in deciding which regions to reach out to when expanding the service.  I was then tasked with regularly updating this table during the time I worked there, as well as creating a guide for other employees on how to create this specific table for when I left.


I hope you take the time to look over my study materials and projects and are willing to consider me for any Data Analyst roles you have available or are aware of.  Thank you.
